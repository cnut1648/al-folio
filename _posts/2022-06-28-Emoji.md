Have you seen this crying face😭? How about 😂, 🥺, 🤣, or ❤️? Looks familiar? Well, you should be. According to emojipedia, [they are the top 5 most used emojipedia on Twitter in 2021](https://blog.emojipedia.org/top-emoji-trends-of-2021/).
By December 2021, a total of 21.54% of all global tweets have at least one of the 3,633 emojis approved by the [Unicode Consortium](https://blog.emojipedia.org/unicode-behind-the-curtain/).
In fact, emoji becomes so popular that [Oxford dictionary listed 😂 as the word of 2015](https://languages.oup.com/word-of-the-year/2015/).
Nowadays emojis are ubiquitous, appearing on virtually any digital platform, including [Tiktok](https://emojipedia.org/tiktok/),
[instagram](https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/introducing-the-emoji-slider-sticker)
, or [email](https://www.guidingtech.com/top-ways-to-insert-emojis-in-a-microsoft-outlook-email/)
. Many people even [choose to incorporate emoji into their username](https://start.y.at/?utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F), and an Artificial Intelligence startup huggingface 🤗 is
evaluated [at $2 billion](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2022/05/09/the-2-billion-emoji-hugging-face-wants-to-be-launchpad-for-a-machine-learning-revolution/?sh=61b47f51f732)
and will potentially be the first company to “go public with an emoji, rather than a three-letter ticker”.

## From XD to 😂

In our daily face-to-face conversations,
we often make use of body language, facial expression or acoustic tone <d-cite key="chen2017through"></d-cite> to better convey our emotions.
Yet such means becomes impossible when we move toward online conversations,
in which we have access to text and plain text only.
Scott Fahlman is probably one of the first people to try imitating more diverse and profound information with plain text.
Emoticons, as later called, were then designed to convey emotion using plain ASCII characters,
two of the most famous Emoticon being “:-)” and “:-(“.
While emoticons like "XD" is easy to understand due to resembling human faces,
some of the emoticons seem more culturally orientated and hard to understand by someone outside of the community.
For example, I probably would never guess the meaning of "#‑)"<d-footnote>If you are also wondering, it means "partied all night." </d-footnote>
Of course, the never-satisfied internet users demand more expressive symbols, leading to the development of the emoticon's successor, the emoji.

Originated in Japanese 絵文字, the name _emoji_ itself precisely expresses its function: 絵 (e) being picture, while 文字 (moji) being character.
Shigetaka Kurita designs the first widely-used emoji.
[It has 250 characters only](https://emojitimeline.com/#:~:text=The%20World's%20First%20Emoji%20Set,Unicode%20Standard%2C%20the%20poo%20emoji).
From this we can grasp what Sheigetaka deemed as the top 250 most important characters in the daily conversation at that time.

Emojis gradually become an integral component in postmodern language.
It is estimated that 92% of the online population use emoji, and at least 2.3 trillion mobile messages
incorporate emoji annually as of 2016 <d-cite key="goldman2018emojis"></d-cite>.
In 2021, Adobe [released the global emoji trend report](https://blog.adobe.com/en/publish/2021/07/15/global-emoji-trend-report-2021)
showing that 55% of global emoji users are more comfortable expressing emotions through emoji than through phone conversations, 
90% of global emoji users agree that emojis make it easier for them to express themselves. 
What's more, although having only 23 years of history, emojis themselves are still expanding rapidly. 
Emoji version 8 (so-called Unicode Version 8.0) came up in 2015, i.e., 8 versions in 16 years, while version 14 came out last year, i.e., roughly one updated version each year.
Therefore, it is not so surprising to see someone will exclaim something like this:

## Emojis are cultural construct 🤔
Don’t you like emojis? 
Don’t you think adding a cute emoji makes the conversation more friendly 😉? 
Adobe report shows that 88% of the global emoji users are more likely to feel empathetic toward someone if they use an emoji. 
I remember once I wanted to do research with a professor at USC and wrote a long email expressing my eagerness and my competency. 
In the end, I wanted to “appeal to the emotion” and hoped my professor feel some emotional connections with me. 
“Hey, we all belong to the Trojan family”, I thought. 
Thus I typed “Fight on✌️!” at the end of the email 
(by the way [this is also the favorite emoji in USC](https://twitter.com/usc/status/1151504550018203648?lang=en)!). 
I hoped that this would give the professor a sense of bondedness, making him harder to refuse my inquiry. 
Does it work? Well, I did get the opportunity to research, and in the email my Professor sent back, she also concluded the email with  “Fight on✌️!”

Use paper word
Human communication is complicated as we exchange profound social and contextual information. Emoji, as a medium of conversation, inevitably share the same complexity.
The interpretation of an emoji is conditioned on the person who uses the emoji, the social understanding of the emoji, and the context emoji is used.
Trojan's motto Fight On is embedded in a simple emoji ✌️, but what about the outsiders?
Will they perceive the symbol✌️ the same? Not likely.
According to [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/victory-hand/),
the symbol ✌️, or victory hand, represents nothing but the [V sign](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/V_sign).
It is USC that injects the additional meaning into it,
therefore if I am going to send someone outside of the Trojan family,
I probably won’t use  “Fight on✌️!” as the ending.

## The room where it happens ⚖️
Given the popularity and proven efficient communication, it is not surprising to see emojis eventually invade courtrooms.
Recent years have witnessed a rise in cases with emojis as evidence.
According to [Santa Clara Law professor Eric Goldman](https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2019/01/emoji-law-2018-year-in-review.htm),
back in 2004 there was only one case involving emojis, and the number went above 100 in 2019.
Yet the cultural aspect of emojis proposes new challenges for judges. They have to decipher the meaning behind those one-character emojis to grasp the intention behind those colorful pictograms.

Image yourself as a landlord; what will you think if you receive the following message from a prospective tenant:
> “Good Morning😊 Interested in the house 💃👯‍♀️✌☄🐿️🍾 When’s a good time for you?”

A married couple Nir and Yarden [sent precisely this to the landlord](https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2020/01/the-israeli-chipmunk-emoji-mystery-resolved.htm)
After reading this message and firmly believing that the couple had expressed a strong passion for the house, the landlord decided to take down the apartment listing from the market and send messages back to Nir and Yarden regarding the details of the housing contract.
Yet the only response he got from the couple after a few days is that they instead rented another apartment.

  <figcaption class="text-center">One sentence and seven emojis can cost you $2,200.
    What does it mean? It means whatever you think it means!
    </figcaption>
</figure>
Agitated, the landlord sued the couple for damages, claiming reliance
—special contract law in Israel, 
that a party acting in reliance on another’s expressed, and sometimes implied intent to agree to a deal may file suit 
if damaged when the other party doesn’t follow through.
How will you judge this case? 
The couple never explicitly confirmed that they would rent the house; they only asked to schedule a meeting with the landlord and had never signed any contract. 
However, the ruling by Judge Amir Weizebbluth is quite the opposite. 
He argued that this text message full of pictograms, smiling face 😊, dancing 💃👯‍♀️, champignon 🍾 all convey “great optimism.” 
He further claimed that
> Although this message did not constitute a binding contract between the parties, [it] naturally led to the Plaintiff’s great reliance on the Defendants’ desire to rent his apartment…

With the postive signal, the landlord's decision is understandable, if not perfectly reasonable based on the couple’s
optimistic and colorful language.
In the end, Nir and Yarden had to pay $2,200 for the bad faith negotiation.
At first glance, this seems somewhat arbitrary
that several emojis would cost two grand. I would rather consider the emojis to be a more approachable technique, similar to what I have done when sending “Fight on✌️!” to my professor.
None of those emojis are equivalent to the couple’s agreement for the contract.
Besides, what does squirrel 🐿️ have to do with positive anyway?
Due to the controversial outcome, this case became a classic in lawsuits that involve emojis, arousing debate on whether
such complicated and multi-meaning emojis can be used as convincing evidence.


The different implementations of emoji standards in various platforms add another layer of complexity.
You might think you send a laughing 😁 emoji to convey a positive signal, but
the receiver [might think you are feeling embarrassing and awkward if he happens to have an IPhone](
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/why-emojis-failing-evolve-form-language-rahul-das/
).

</figure>

Moreover, emojis within the exact implementation can also get easily confused due to the mobile phone’s relatively small screen size.
Consider the following [outrageous case happened in German](https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2021/09/a-roundup-of-german-caselaw-regarding-emojis-and-emoticons-guest-blog-post.htm)
where two employees were accused of insulting two managers in the company.
Here is an excerpt of the chat history between the two employees

> Employee 1: The fat 🐷 goes crazy!!! 😜😜😜
>
> Employee 2: You mean the piglet roasting on a spit!!! 😭😭
>
> Employee 1: Hahahah
>
> Employee 2: “And the 🐵head too!!! 😂😂😂😜😜

While the first “fat 🐷” is rather obvious, the phrase “🐵head” gathered much attention from judges.
Calling someone monkey head is probably not the most polite term one should call the manager,
but calling the manager bear head is considered an insult, given the manager’s broad facial features.
Later in the assessment, it seems that the two employees mistakenly perceived the emoji of a monkey as the emoji of a bear.
In other words, the employees are deliberately making fun of the manager using the emoji of the bear.

  <figcaption class="text-center">
    The emoji of monkey and bear showing in the employee's phone screen.
    </figcaption>
</figure>
It is not the emoji itself that judges look for, but how the employees perceive this (although deviating from the standard norm) that becomed the evidence judges utilized for the claim of insultance.

Not all emojis are created equal. Some emojis are more likely to get you arrested.
[In 2016, there was a 12-year old that got arrested after posting on Instagram with
🔫🔪💣
emojis](https://www.businessinsider.com/a-12-year-old-girl-is-facing-criminal-charges-for-using-emoji-and-shes-not-the-only-one-2016-2).
However, this “might get you arrested” list of emojis is not exhaustive.
Even an emoji that appears innocent and neutral in most scenarios can be found threatening in a particular context.

[For example](https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/judge-stumped-by-emoji-threat/JARMEX55HERKD5NMFJVINCOLWY/),
a judge sent a woman’s ex-partner to jail for eight months for sending the following message to the woman’s social media account:
> You're going to f***ing get it,✈

Even though the aeroplane is considered harmless in most cases, in this scenario, both woman and the judge agree that this is a symbol of threat, suggesting that the ex-partner is coming to her.
It seems that we have left the situation puzzling about what those little pictograms mean when deriving from context.
It is hard to gain a universal consensus about whether they indicate a sense of anger, humor, or other emotions, which probably is not what the inventor of emojis envision emojis to be.


The rapid-changing emojis have impeded the judgements in court. If emoji were to function as an evidence, discriminating
the inherent definiton becomes a virtual problem. The existing emojipedia is far from satisfaction, as it provides explantion
purely based on the designer's intention. However in practice the precise interpration depends on the context and who is sending the emoji.
Adobe 63% of Gen Z’ers mention that they use emoji differently than their intended meaning,
with the most misunderstood emojis being 🍆<d-footnote>Interesting, Pornhub has released its own set of emojis, entitled "Emoji 4 Porn", with eggplant being one of them.</d-footnote>
One time when I send a meme to my American friend, he replied me with "funny 🙂".
Then [as a chinese](https://qz.com/944693/chinese-people-mean-something-very-different-when-they-send-you-a-smiley-emoji/),
I begun to question myself if I have done anything wrong to him, since we Chinese only use smiling face
as a sutble medium to convey mocking and despise.
Japan also has their own emoji culture that differ from American's.
Researchers at Princeton and University College London have trained a neural network on English Tweeters and
project a list of emojis into a 2D Cartesian plane <d-cite key="eisner2016emoji2vec"></d-cite>.
The visualization is shown in the left figure below.
The closer two emojis are in the plane, the semantically closer the two emojis are.
We can observe several clusters including cluster of national flags, cluster of digits and cluster of laughing faces etc.
Yet such pattern is not universal,
as found by Japanese researchers at Univesity of Tsukuba <d-cite key="tomihira2020multilingual"></d-cite>.
They conduct similar experiments on Japanese social media and found that laughing are not tightly close <d-footnote>
They use common emojis used by Japanese, which is also significantly less than Americans.</d-footnote>.

They credit the disparity in emoji semnatic similiartiy to the difference in emoji culture. They found that for the same sentencec Japanese sometimes
will react in a different emoji.
