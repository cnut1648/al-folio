Hi there üëã

I am a research scientist at NVIDIA. 
I was a master student at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) studying computer science.
Previously I double majored in applied mathematics and computer science at [USC](https://www.usc.edu/).
I had the honor to work with Prof. [Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/) at Harvard SEAS, and Prof. [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/) at USC.
I have spent a bit of time as research intern at Amazon Science team working on LLM and as student collaborator at Microsoft Research working on synthetic data generation.

My current research interests is in `Reliable AI`. Particularly,

- AI safety [[1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.14710.pdf), [2](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09763.pdf), [3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12255)]
- Training AI that excels in low-resource regime, through indirect supervision [[1](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.138.pdf), [2](https://aclanthology.org/2022.naacl-main.190.pdf)] or synthetic data [[3](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2022/papers_ECCV/papers/136830463.pdf), [4](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.09592), [5](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05956), [6](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14216.pdf)]
- Explanation and how we can learn from explanation [[1](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/file/9752d873fa71c19dc602bf2a0696f9b5-Paper.pdf), [2](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00738-y), [3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-022-00738-y)]
