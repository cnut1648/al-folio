Hi there 👋

I am a master student at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/) studying computer science.
Previously I double majored in applied mathematics and computer science at [USC](https://www.usc.edu/).
I had the honor to work with Prof. [Hima Lakkaraju](https://himalakkaraju.github.io/) at Harvard SEAS, and Prof. [Muhao Chen](https://muhaochen.github.io/) at USC.

My current research interests is in `machine learning` and `natural language processing`. Particularly,
- transparent and robust NLP system
- high-level supervisions for model regularization

This is my girlfriend 😍[Carmen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carmen-liang/) and me
